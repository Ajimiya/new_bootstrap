      <div class="desc">
        <p class="par">Kathkali is a major form of classical Indian dance.It is a "story play" genre of art, but one distinguished by the elaborately colourful make-up and costumes of the traditional male actor-dancers. It is native to the Malayalam-speaking southwestern region of Kerala and is almost entirely practiced and appreciated by Malayali people.</p> 
        <h4 class=""><center>COSTUMES</center></h4>
        <p class="par">The symbolism which is followed in the make-up and headgears is also carried out in the costume colours worn by the various characters. The Pachcha characters usually wear a jacket of either purple, blue or yellow colour. The red-beards wear a red jacket and the white-beards wear a white jacket. While the scarfs which hang on either side follow the colour patterns set by the make-up. The lower half of the costume of Kathakali dancer is common to all types excepting the minukku characters. An attempt is made to enlarge the actors proportions by using heavily plaited skirts. Beneath this awe-inspiring make-up huge headgear and spectacular costume is a most pliable, lithe, slim and well-trained body.
            Most male characters wear dark full-sleeved jackets with coloured or white bulging long skirts. Lengths of white  cloth thrown over the shoulders are also there. The female characters wear their hair in a knot on the top of the forehead veiled with a ornamented scarf falling over red jackets coupled with a white sari covering the lower half of the body.
